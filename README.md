# Game Engine
To run it for yourself you first need to install all of the dependencies in the `package.json`. <br>
Normaly you would compile all of the typescript but that <b>wont</b> work anymore.
<br>
Please run the `package.json` script to start the application with the already exisiting js files.

```
$ npm run start
```

Build should be available on my [github website](https://arturwagnerbusiness.github.io)
###### On a side note, I used electron-packager to create a runnable application.
